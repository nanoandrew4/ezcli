# ezcli
---

ezcli is a project aimed at enhancing a users terminal experience, by creating a programmable layer of shortcuts and features to minimize your key strokes and mouse moving, while integrating with your favourite terminal so you can easily fall back to your comfortable command line interface when needed.

## About
---

This project is still under active development, and the first official major release has not yet been achieved. Therefore, this document, as well as any others in this project are subject to change as development progresses.
To get an idea of where the project is at, check out the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Why use ezcli
---

(Features specified here not indicative of the current state of development, but of the features that will be included in the first major release)

* **Classic terminal, but better**: runs on top of your terminal. You can still drop easily drop to it to perfrom whatever tasks you need done.
* **Lightweight**: Purely text based, which reduces storage requirements and maximizes performance.
* **Easy to use**: Navigate, open and run your files from a text based file explorer with the press of a key.
* **Reuse input**: Do you frequently type the same series of commands, or access the same directories? Reuse all that old input without having to type it all out again and again with a couple of key presses.
* **Programmable**: Don't like how something looks, or rather input your own shortcuts to folders or for running commands? Simply modify your config files, and voila!
* **Modular**: Built on modules, so you can customize it to your liking, and even write your own modules to compile alongside the core program for added functionality.
